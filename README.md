PiCAST
===
<h3>Turn a $35 Raspberry Pi in to a Chromecast like Device, for FREE.</h3>
<hr>

<h3><u>Why Make the PiCAST?</u></h3>
I wanted to buy a Google Chromecast but it was sold out, thanks to people like Leo from TWiT who got 5 (kidding)!
So, I thought what do I have that I could use w/HDMI [licensing] and wouldn't be terribly hard to do? My Arduino?
Nope BUT my Raspberry Pi can do it all, literally and same price as the Chromecast.

<h3><u>Why Open Source?</u></h3>
I'm not happy how the Chromecast isn't very open... So, with the easy to use API-like calling, you can just call the URL
and yes the project is far from complete-- it's just a fun learning exercise & hope kids will see how you can go and
try to mimmic what you can't get it (even if you have the cash).

<b>This is far from complete. Lot of new features to come and of course fix the code up. But, at least we have something
to start playing with...</b>

<h3><u>Donate with BitCoin!</u></h3>
A friend of mine has already bugged me, to charge for the code... I can't or won't. I will however as always offer my
BitCoin address for anyone who'd like to donate, donations will go to Opportunity Village(http://www.opportunityvillage.org).

*** YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DONATE. THIS IS OF COURSE COMPLETELY OPTIONAL, THIS WILL ALWAYS REMAIN FREE! ***
