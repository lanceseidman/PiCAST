PiCAST 2.0 (stable)

<h3>Turn a $35 Raspberry Pi in to a Chromecast like Device, for FREE.</h3>
<hr>

PiCAST turns your $35 Raspberry Pi in to a Chromecast like Device.

<h3><u>Why Make the PiCAST?</u></h3>
I wanted to buy a Google Chromecast originally but it was sold out. So, I thought what do I have that I could use w/HDMI and wouldn't be terribly hard to do? My Raspberry Pi can do it all, literally and same price as the Chromecast and OPEN SOURCE, CUSTOM MAKE FEATURES, <obvious reasons here>.

As its been some time now since the original PiCAST, the project got some bad notes on how it was too "hard" to figure out or install, wasn't safe enough, the way I programmed it wasn't to his/her liking and enough is enough, I got tired of it. HOWEVER, because the project DID have some really great interest- I re-did the project without web technologies.

<h3>THIS ISN'T CHROMECAST! YOU LIE!!!</h3>
As many seem unable to read or understand where the project CURRENTLY is and where it WILL go, I felt I need to dumb it
down even more. This project doesn't have over 20-100+ paid-staffers, millions of dollars backed to ensure it succeeds, 
a dedicated team, and MONTHS & MONTHS of work where the PiCAST HAS NONE OF THE ABOVE-- so, calm down!

I made it very clear, this is "LIKE" a chromecast project, already as it can be sent commands REMOTELY just like the 
Chromecast, so project is over... Kidding! I am working on the BEST possible method(s) to continue forward.

So before you go nuts that the project isn't what YOU think, think twice. I do have a full-time job BUT I am so
upset with Google, I want an OPEN, FREE, US/NON-US PERMITTED USERBASE, and if you're against it? Don't download it,
go make your own and share it or don't. I live in the US, I now have a Chromecast, I don't NEED the project BUT
I want it as I feel so strongly that what Google is doing is beyond unfair-- agree? JOIN ME! STOP YOUR COMPLAINT, DO
SOMETHING!

<h3><u>Why Open Source?</u></h3>
I'm not happy how the Chromecast isn't very open... So, with the easy to use API-like via IP, you can just call URL's
and yes the project is far from complete-- it's just a fun learning exercise & hope kids will see how you can go and
try to mimmic what you can't get it (even if you have the cash).

<b>This is <i>far</i> from complete. Lot of new features to come and of course fix the code up. But, at least we have something
to start playing with...</b>
